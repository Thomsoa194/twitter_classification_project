# twitter_classification_project
 Using Supervised Learning to classify tweets as being as from New York, London or Paris.
 
In the following project, I'm going to use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral. By doing do I will answer the following question:

Which features of a tweet are most closely linked to its popularity? Maybe the number of hashtags or the number of links in the tweet strongly influences its popularity. Maybe its virality is dependent on how many followers the person has. Maybe it's something more subtle like the specific language used in the tweets.

Afterwards, I will analyze twitter data to determine whether it was from New York, Paris or London using Naive Bayes classifier.
